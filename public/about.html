  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%">Find the <i>best place to vote right now</i> for the May 27, 2014 primary run-off election in Travis County.</p>

  <p>This application finds voting places closest to where you are right now.</p>

  <p>It knows not only about day-of-the-election voting places, but also early voting
    places -- both the fixed locations that are available throughout the early voting
    period as well as mobile locations that move around from day to day.</p>

  <p>Depending on your web browser settings, you may be prompted to
    allow your location to be identified. Once you have been located,
    it will draw a map showing your position and nearby voting places.</p>

  <p>Here are some things you can do with the map:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drag the red "you are here" marker around, to explore a different area.</li>
    <li>Click a location on the map to find voting places near there.</li>
    <li>Type an address in the field at the bottom of the screen to map that location.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Elections in the City of Austin are administered by the Travis
    County Clerk's Election Division.</p>

    </ul>

  <h2>Voting Places</h2>

  <p>The "Vote" icons identify voting places for the selected "you are here" location.</p>  

  <p>A "lit up" icon shows a voting place open right now. A dimmed icon shows a closed
    voting place.</p>
  
  <table class="icon-key">
    <tr>
      <td class="icon"><img src="mapicons/icon_vote.png" style="width: 32px; height: 32px"/></td>
      <td>
        <p>The election day voting place for the "you are here" location.</p>
        <p>This is the place you go to vote on election day.</p>
        <p>Note that for some elections, the State of Texas allows "Election Day Vote Centers".
          For these elections, you can vote at any polling place, not just the one in your
          assigned neighborhood precinct.</p>
        <p>Election day vote centers <em>will be</em> in effect for
          the this election.  That means you may vote at any designated
          voting place for this election.</p>

      <td>
        <p>The early voting place that is closest to the "you are here" location.</p>
        <p>If you are registered to vote in Travis County, then you can vote at any of the
         early voting places during the early voting period.</p>

      <td>
        <p>A <em>mobile</em> early voting place that is convenient to the "you are here" location.</p>
        <p>The mobile early voting places are open only at certain times during the early voting
          period. If you are registered to vote in Travis County, then you can vote at any mobile
          early voting place that is open.</p>
        <p>The map will display <em>only</em> mobile early voting places that are convenient to
          your "you are here" location. You won't see any mobile places if you are in a location
          where the fixed early voting place is the best choice.</p>
