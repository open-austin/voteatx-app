  <h1>Find It Nearby</h1>

  <p>The "Find It Nearby" application will identify features in
    Austin, TX that are closest to you. The features it knows about are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>police station</li>
    <li>fire station</li>
    <li>post office</li>
    <li>library</li>
    <li>moon tower (<a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_tower#Moonlight_towers_in_Austin.2C_Texas">huh?</a>)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you first start the application it will try to determine
    where you are. Depending on your web browser settings, you may be
    promoted to allow your location to be identified. Once you have been
    located, it will draw a map showing your position and the nearby
    features.</p>

  <p>Here are some things you can do with the map:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click at a location on the map to see what features are
      nearby.</li>
    <li>Drag the red "you are here" marker around, to explore a
      different area.</li>
    <li>Type an address in the field at the bottom of the screen to
      map that location.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Voting Place</h2>

  <p>The "Vote" icon identifies the voting place for the selected
    location.</p>

  <p>The voting place data is for the May 12, 2012 Austin municipal
    election.</p>

  <p>This feature is experimental. Please report any problems to <a
      href="mailto:chip@unicom.com">chip@unicom.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Known Problem: Travis County did not publish a great data set of
    voting places. I took a list and manually ran "geolocation" on the
    addresses, which failed or provided bogus results for many locations.
    For instance, the precinct 252 voting place is showing the North
    Village Library on the wrong side of Mo-Pac.</p>

  <p>I will see if this can be remedied in future elections.</p>

  <p>Kudos to the Travis County Tax Collector-Assessor office, for
    providing geographic data for voting district boundaries.</p>

  <h2>Powered by Open Source and Open Government</h2>

  <p>In January 2012, the City of Austin release the <a
      href="http://data.austintexas.gov/">data.austintexas.gov</a> open
    government data portal. This application is built on publicly
    available data provided there. At this time, there are only a
    limited number of data collections available, so only a small set of
    features are supported here. What else would you like to see? How
    about police stations? Driver license offices? Public wi-fi access
    points? If the City releases that information, I'll add it to the
    application.</p>

  <p>This application is written by Chip Rosenthal, with support from the
    "Find It" team from the "Code for America Hack-a-Thon", February
    2012. The source is available at: <a
