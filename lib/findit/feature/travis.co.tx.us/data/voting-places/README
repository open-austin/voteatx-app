Notes on Voting Place Generation

Voting_Places_20120512.csv

    May 29, 2012 -- Voting_Places_20120731.csv

    The "20120512-GA12-May_12_EDay_Polling_Places_Guide_Final.xls",
    file is the source to a PDF "voting place" document published by
    Travis County. I extracted the locations and did a batch geolocation
    to obtain the resulting dataset. The quality is poor: there are
    locations with missing lat/lng information and locations with wrong
    lat/lng inforation.

    This dataset was generated by scraping www.traviscountytax.org with
    20120731-tcvp-scraper.rb

Voting_Places_20121106.csv

    Nov 6, 2012 -- General Election (Presidential)

    Got a *GREAT* dataset ("20121106-chipG12_WEBLoad_FINAL.xlsx")
    from Travis County Elections Division. Extracted the sheet with
    election day places to "20121106-chipG12_WEBLoad_FINAL_EDay.csv",
    and then ran "20121106-generate.rb" to convert to our standard
    form.
